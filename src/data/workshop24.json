    "desc": "We offer aspiring engineers the opportunity to explore the future work environment through our workshop. This program serves as an introduction to the realm of sensorics and sensor integration using Virtual Instrumentation (VI) software. Participants will engage in hands-on training sessions, gaining practical experience in acquiring data and implementing control actions with VI software (LabVIEW) and Data Acquisition cards. Additionally, the workshop provides training on the development of robots using LEGO kits and sensors. This comprehensive learning experience aims to equip participants with valuable skills for their future endeavors.",
